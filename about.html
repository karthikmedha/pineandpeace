    <h1>About This Project</h1>
    <p>This is a soft, slow space to share poems about nature, stillness, and the moments in between. Some of the poems are mine, others just speak to me. This site is a creative escapeâ€”and a chance to practice web design in a way that feels like me.</p>
    <p>Minimal design. Earthy tones. Nothing loud. Just words, feelings, and room to breathe.</p>
