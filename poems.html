    <h2>Still Pine</h2>
    <p>Whispers echo in the forest’s chest,<br>
    Where time drips slow and roots find rest.<br>
    A needle falls—so gently, so sound—<br>
    Soft as silence on forest ground.</p>

    <h2>Blue Haze</h2>
    <p>Under twilight’s ocean sky,<br>
    I watch the mountains exhale a sigh.<br>
    The breeze knows things it’ll never say—<br>
    I breathe it in anyway.</p>

    <h2>Riverbed</h2>
    <p>Water hums beneath the stone,<br>
    A song that sings of being alone.<br>
    But not lonely, not today—<br>
    Just drifting gently on its way.</p>

    <h2>Cloud Mirror</h2>
    <p>The lake holds sky in open palms,<br>
    Reflecting both the rush and calm.<br>
    I sit, I watch, I start to feel<br>
    That maybe quiet things are real.</p>

    <h2>Rooted</h2>
    <p>I don’t need answers all the time,<br>
    Just a tree, a breeze, and space to climb.<br>
    Let the questions come and go—<br>
    Like leaves that fall, like streams that flow.</p>
